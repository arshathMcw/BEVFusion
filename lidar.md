## LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging)
* LiDAr uses Ultravioled Visible Infrared source to sense the onject
* Light emitted from the LiDAR is pulse and reflected in known as Return
* SONAR uses sound waves to map things , RADAR uses Radio waves like that LiDAR uses light sent from the laser
### Types of LiDAR
1. Topographic LiDAR : Used for mapped land typically using neared-infrared light
1.
1. Terestrial LiDAR : For mapping building and natural features and trees at ground level and useful for 3D model for heritage sites
